# Optimized implementation of qTESLA-II in portable C + some very limited use of x64 assembly (for the 
# Barrett reduction in poly.c)

# Linux

To compile, do:

make 

which by default sets ARCH=x64, CC=gcc and DEBUG=FALSE, or do:

make CC=[gcc/clang] DEBUG=[TRUE/FALSE]

The following executables are generated: "test_qtesla-II", "PQCtestKAT_sign-II" and "PQCgenKAT_sign-II".

To get cycle counts for key generation, signing and verification, execute:

./test_qtesla-II

To test against known answer values in the KAT folder, execute:

./PQCtestKAT_sign-II

To generate new KAT files, execute:

./PQCgenKAT_sign-II

Using DEBUG=TRUE generates statistics on acceptance rates and timings for internal functions.
